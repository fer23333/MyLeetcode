Before going to on-site interview, there was a homework designing Drone Delivery System. On the onsite interview, first round is manager interview, second round is Tech interview, which let me explain the Drone Delivery System.
Instead of discuss with you, the manager challenge you a lot, with aggressive attitude.
The design part, the design granularity is very unclear, which make the whole process very dizzy.

Q1: Describe a project Q2: Explain your drone delivery code. Q3: How to add a battery function to your designed drone.

Q1: Prepare resume Q2: Explain, which is easy using PriorityQueue Q3: Use OOD to add a battery function


第一轮面经：简单问了一下基本信息，怎么做quicksort，解释了一下RESTful API 等等。. check 1point3acres for more.
第二轮面经：发了一个assignment，电影院位置分配问题。然后 全程一个小时面试都是看code，一行行看，顺带问一些OOD的东西。不知道有没有后续消息。bless！！

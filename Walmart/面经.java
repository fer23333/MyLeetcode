Before going to on-site interview, there was a homework designing Drone Delivery System. On the onsite interview, first round is manager interview, second round is Tech interview, which let me explain the Drone Delivery System.
Instead of discuss with you, the manager challenge you a lot, with aggressive attitude.
The design part, the design granularity is very unclear, which make the whole process very dizzy.

Q1: Describe a project Q2: Explain your drone delivery code. Q3: How to add a battery function to your designed drone.

Q1: Prepare resume Q2: Explain, which is easy using PriorityQueue Q3: Use OOD to add a battery function

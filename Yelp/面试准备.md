# Why Yelp
Because I know that Yelp is a top company which provides reviews ,photos and a lot of services. And there are a lot of talented people in amazon creating amazing products to make people’s life easier. They are always showing strong ownership to their projects and they always want to make things perfect.  

the purpose of yelp is : To connect people with great local businesses. I’m a very helpful person and care a lot about customer experience, so the culture of Yelp attracts me a lot. 
Furthermore, the growth of this company is pretty impressive, it’s not only a company focus on local business but also has a wide range of products like Yelp.com, mobile apps and Yelp also integrate with Grubhub/delivery/google map, car service, home sevice and more.

lots talented engineers are working passionately here, building innovative system and solving problems at an impressive scale(now over 100 million reviews on yelp). I am very interested in improving the review qualities like removing fraud customers/ merchants and improving recommending algorithm, creating great new features.
Therefore, this is a place where I can learn a lot, and use my skills and experience to make things happen within a team.

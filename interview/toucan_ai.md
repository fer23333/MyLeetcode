We're looking for someone interested in pushing the boundaries of open NLP problems like neural question answering, question generation, emotion analysis, and open-domain casual conversation. We're a young startup looking to make our first hires, so applicants can expect to play a key role in making product and business decisions. The ideal candidate: 


Some experience with Natural Language Processing, either research or practical
Experience coding in Python
Familiar with modern machine learning & deep learning techniques (ideally, but not necessarily, in the PyTorch framework)
Preferably familiar with a React-based web-development stack 

Integrated a live chatting robot trained with Tensorflow and NLP model with LSTM for real-time customer service.

# supervised learning:

## main task : 
 1. regression : predicting a continuous value
 
 2.classification 



### Linear regression (ordinary least squares)

### Gradient descent
it will come up over and over again, especially in neural networks. Machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow use it in the background everywhere, so it’s worth understanding the details.

The goal of gradient descent is to find the minimum of our model’s loss function by iteratively getting a better and better approximation of it.

### overfitting

to avoid that

1. Use more training data. The more you have, the harder it is to overfit the data by learning too much from any single training example.

2. Use regularization. Add in a penalty in the loss function for building a model that assigns too much explanatory power to any one feature or allows too many features to be taken into account.

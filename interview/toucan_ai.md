We're looking for someone interested in pushing the boundaries of open NLP problems like neural question answering, question generation, emotion analysis, and open-domain casual conversation. We're a young startup looking to make our first hires, so applicants can expect to play a key role in making product and business decisions. The ideal candidate: 


Some experience with Natural Language Processing, either research or practical
Experience coding in Python
Familiar with modern machine learning & deep learning techniques (ideally, but not necessarily, in the PyTorch framework)
Preferably familiar with a React-based web-development stack 

Integrated a live chatting robot trained with Tensorflow and NLP model with LSTM for real-time customer service.

A LSTM network is a kind of recurrent neural network. A recurrent neural network is a neural network that attempts to model time or sequence dependent behaviour â€“ such as language, stock prices, electricity demand and so on. This is performed by feeding back the output of a neural network layer at time t to the input of the same network layer at time t + 1

seq2seq encoder RNN decoder RNN


Preprocessing: Convert the question-and-answer pairs into vectorized format, which will be utilized in model training.
Model building and validation: Develop deep learning models and validate the data.
Prediction of answers from trained model: The trained model will be used to predict answers for given questions.
